                        <p>
                        The Epic Games APK is the official Android application developed by Epic Games, designed to function as a launcher and marketplace for their games.

                        <p>
                        Initially, Epic Games made headlines by offering their flagship title, <strong>Fortnite</strong>, directly through their own platform, bypassing conventional app stores. This move was part of a broader strategy to establish a direct relationship with their user base and offer a curated gaming experience.
