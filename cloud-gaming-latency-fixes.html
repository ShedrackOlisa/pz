                        <h2>Cloud Gaming in Competitive Environments</h2>
                        <p>Playing competitive games via cloud platforms (e.g., Fortnite, Apex Legends) requires extremely low latency. If your primary goal is ranked or professional gaming, here are some final thoughts:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Use platforms that support NVIDIA Reflex:</strong> Games optimized with Reflex show reduced system latency.</li>
